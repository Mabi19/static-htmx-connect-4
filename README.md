# Static HTMX Connect 4

[Play it here](https://mabi.land/static-htmx-connect-4/). You'll need a browser that supports `:has`.

This is an implementation of Connect 4, made with HTMX and a *lot* of CSS.
HTMX isn't powerful enough to drive the game logic without a backend server (which is a good thing normally),
so it's basically only used to insert new tokens into the game board.

Soon there'll be a blog post explaining how it works. But not yet.
